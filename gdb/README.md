# gdb

## contents

- `.gidbinit`: pure settings, w/o plugins. expected to be used for heavy program such as LinuxKernel.
- `.gdbinit.pwn`: pwn settings, using pwndbg.
- `.gdbinit.pwn.sp`: using splitmind. never used.

## notes

- history saving is off.
- confirmation is off.
- simple stacktrace and reg info are shown when pwndbg is not used. (like TUI, which seems bad for me.)
